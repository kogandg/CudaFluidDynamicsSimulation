# Introduction 

The goal of this was to learn CUDA and create a fun simulation to have a visual product of the learning. 

Fluid simulation is a solid base block for simulating lots of interesting phenomena like smoke curling, steam from tea, or paint mixing. This problem is also particularly suited to CUDA GPU programming as it is very parallelizable.
